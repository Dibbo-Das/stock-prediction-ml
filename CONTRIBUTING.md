# Contributing Guide

## 🌳 Branching Strategy
* **Never** push directly to `main`.
* Create a new branch for every task:
  * `feature/data-loader` (for new features)
  * `fix/broken-link` (for bug fixes)
  * `docs/update-readme` (for documentation)

## 💾 Commit Messages
* Use clear messages:
  * ✅ "Added LSTM model class"
  * ❌ "fixed stuff"

## 🤝 Pull Requests (PR)
* When you finish a task, open a Pull Request on GitHub.
* Another team member must review and approve it before merging.
