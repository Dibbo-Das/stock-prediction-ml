# Stock Prediction Project Plan

## 1. Objective
Build a Machine Learning model to predict S&P 500 stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## 2. Team Roles
* **Member 1 (You):** Infrastructure, Git setup, Data Pipeline.
* **Member 2:** Model Architecture (TensorFlow/PyTorch).
* **Member 3:** Data Visualization & Analysis.

## 3. Timeline
* **Week 1:** Setup & Data Collection (yfinance).
* **Week 2:** Data Preprocessing (Normalization).
* **Week 3:** Model Training & Tuning.
* **Week 4:** Final Report & Presentation.
